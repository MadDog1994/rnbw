# contributing to rainbow

a big welcome and thank you for considering contributing to rainbow!

contributions are always welcome, and you can quickly get your fix or improvement slated for the next release.

the contributorsâ€™ community can be found on [github discussions](), where you can ask questions, voice ideas, and share your projects.

## get started

1. fork the repository to your own github account.
2. clone the repository
    
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:username/rainbow.git
    ```
    
3. run the project from the root directory.
    
    ```
    npm install --force
    ```
    
    ```
    npm start
    ```
    
4. visitÂ `http://localhost:8080/`
5. create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name.
6. learn the rainbow structure.
7. follow the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/rnbwdev/projects/4/views/1) and take the first to-do that makes sense to you. go top-down.
    1. focus on the terms and specs for each task.
    2. make sure you fully understand it before you begin
8. code!
    1. please keep the best practices and code style and follow any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo.
    2. collaborate. collaborate. collaborate. update where you are. share what you did and what you will do.
9. commit changes to your branch. (donâ€™t rush to push the latest code to your branch. thatâ€™s a waste of time.)
    1. we will review your code and the user experience and provide feedback. always prioritize tasks with existing feedback.
10. keep your branch always in sync with the dev branch.

## prs

in general, prs should:

- address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
- include documentation in the repo or on our docs site.
- be accompanied by a complete pull request template (loaded automatically when a pr is created).

> for changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g. a major release), it's best to open an issue to discuss your proposal first. this is not required but can save time in creating and reviewing changes.
> 

> search for existing issues and prs before creating your own
> 

> if you find an issue that addresses your problem, please add your reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. adding a reaction can also help indicate to our maintainers that a particular problem is affecting more than just the reporter.

that's it! ðŸŽ‰
